    "## 8 - The Future: LLMs and influence diagrams\n",
    "\n",
    "The current capabilities of LLMs in **comprehending decision problems** and **utilizing tools** fuel my optimism integrating them with influence diagrams. I foresee two main steps in this integration process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Short-term objective:** Using LLMs to input data into an established influence diagram model and format the outputs from the diagram to generate \"intelligent\" text.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Long-term objective:** Enabling LLMs to analyze problems and automatically generate the appropriate influence diagrams. These diagrams would then be used to solve the problems and format the output accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "From an implementation perspective, there are several ways to integrate LLMs with influence diagrams:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Develop custom tools within LangChain to allow seamless interfacing with existing influence diagrams](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/tools/custom_tools/) . This would enable agents to utilize and interact directly with complex decision models.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Leverage the capabilities of PyAgrum to generate influence diagrams from text using the `fastID()` method](https://pyagrum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fastSyntax.html#pyAgrum.fastID). This could involve training an LLM to create these diagrams either automatically or through guided instructions. The diagrams could then be executed in a \"controlled\" manner. This would enhance the model reasning capabilities by enabling dynamic creation and utilization of decision models.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Utilize the coding capabilities of LLMs to generate and execute Python code](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/integrations/toolkits/python/). While this approach might be the most powerful, it is also the furthest from current capabilities and would require some form of supervision for security reasons."
